## ðŸŒ†âš¡ The Ultimate Netrunner Homelab Experience âš¡ðŸŒ†

ðŸ”¥ A complete cyberpunk-themed homelab ecosystem that transforms your boring infrastructure into a full-scale corpo network simulation! This isn't just monitoring - it's living the netrunner dream with authentic ICE firewalls, data fortress architectures, and neural interface dashboards that make you feel like you're jacked into the Net itself.

### ðŸ¤–ðŸ’€ Core Systems:

- ICE Defense Grid: Real firewall management disguised as cutting-edge intrusion countermeasures
- Data Fortress: Network storage that feels like raiding Arasaka vaults
- Neural Dashboard: System monitoring with that authentic braindance UI glow
- Netrunner Terminal: Command interfaces that would make Alt Cunningham proud
 -Corporate Database: Mock data streams flowing like liquid information through fiber optic veins

ðŸŒƒðŸ”® Built for sysadmins who want their infrastructure to feel less like Excel spreadsheets and more like shadowrunning through Night City's corporate networks. Every service, every dashboard, every alert notification drips with that chrome-and-neon aesthetic that makes routine maintenance feel like high-stakes digital heists.

âš¡ðŸŽ¯ Because why settle for boring monitoring when you can be a legend in your own cyberpunk network? Welcome to the Net, runner. Try not to get your brain fried. ðŸ§ ðŸ’¥
